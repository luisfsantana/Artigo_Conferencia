	Abstract = {The research area of Multimedia Content Analysis (MMCA) considers all aspects of the automated extraction of knowledge from multimedia archives and data streams. To satisfy the increasing computational demands of MMCA problems, the use of High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques is essential. As most MMCA researchers are not HPC experts, there is an urgent need for `familiar' programming models and tools that are both easy to use and efficient.

Today, several user transparent library-based parallelization tools exist that aim to satisfy both these requirements. In general, such tools focus on data parallel execution on traditional compute clusters. As of yet, none of these tools also incorporate the use of many-core processors (e.g. GPUs), however. While traditional clusters are now being transformed into GPU-clusters, programming complexity vastly increases -- and the need for easy and efficient programming models is as urgent as ever.

This paper presents our first steps in the direction of obtaining a user transparent programming model for data parallel and hierarchical multimedia computing on GPU-clusters. The model is obtained by extending an existing user transparent parallel programming system (applicable to traditional compute clusters) with a set of CUDA compute kernels. We show our model to be capable of obtaining orders-of-magnitude speed improvements, without requiring any additional effort from the application programmer.},

@conference{Kim,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose SnuCL, an OpenCL framework for heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters. We show that the original OpenCL semantics naturally fits to the heterogeneous cluster programming environment, and the framework achieves high performance and ease of programming. The target cluster architecture consists of a designated, single host node and many compute nodes. They are connected by an interconnection network, such as Gigabit Ethernet and InfiniBand switches. Each compute node is equipped with multicore CPUs and multiple GPUs. A set of CPU cores or each GPU becomes an OpenCL compute device. The host node executes the host program in an OpenCL application. SnuCL provides a system image running a single operating system instance for heterogeneous CPU/GPU clusters to the user. It allows the application to utilize compute devices in a compute node as if they were in the host node. No communication API, such as the MPI library, is required in the application source. SnuCL also provides collective communication extensions to OpenCL to facilitate manipulating memory objects. With SnuCL, an OpenCL application becomes portable not only between heterogeneous devices in a single node, but also between compute devices in the cluster environment. We implement SnuCL and evaluate its performance using eleven OpenCL benchmark applications.},

@conference{Flat,
	Abstract = {For leveraging multiple GPUs in a cluster system, it is necessary to assign application tasks to multiple GPUs and execute those tasks with appropriately using communication primitives to handle data transfer among GPUs. In current GPU programming models, communication primitives such as MPI functions cannot be used within GPU kernels. Instead, such functions should be used in the CPU code. Therefore, programmer must handle both GPU kernel and CPU code for data communications. This makes GPU programming and its optimization very difficult.

In this paper, we propose a programming framework named FLAT which enables programmers to use MPI functions within GPU kernels. Our framework automatically transforms MPI functions written in a GPU kernel into runtime routines executed on the CPU. The execution model and the implementation of FLAT are described, and the applicability of FLAT in terms of scalability and programmability is discussed. We also evaluate the performance of FLAT. The result shows that FLAT achieves good scalability for intended applications.},

This GPU version is developed based on a CPU DFT-PWP code: PEtot, which can calculate up to a thousand atoms on thousands of processors. Our test indicates that the GPU version can have a ~10 times speed-up over the CPU version. A detail analysis of the speed-up and the scaling on the number of CPU/GPU computing units (up to 256) are presented. The success of our speed-up relies on the adoption a hybrid reciprocal-space and band-index parallelization scheme. As far as we know, this is the first GPU DFT-PWP code scalable to large number of CPU/GPU computing units. We also outlined the future work, and what is needed to further increase the computational speed by another factor of 10.},

	Abstract = {Rapid advances in the performance and programmability of graphics accelerators have made GPU computing a compelling solution for a wide variety of application domains. However, the increased complexity as a result of architectural heterogeneity and imbalances in hardware resources poses significant programming challenges in harnessing the performance advantages of GPU accelerated parallel systems. Moreover, the speedup derived from GPU often gets offset by longer communication latencies and inefficient task scheduling. To achieve the best possible performance, a suitable parallel programming model is therefore essential.

In this paper, we explore a new hybrid parallel programming model that incorporates GPU acceleration with the Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming paradigm. As we demonstrate, by combining Unified Parallel C (UPC) and CUDA as a case study, this hybrid model offers programmers with both enhanced programmability and powerful heterogeneous execution. Two application benchmarks, namely NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) FT and MG, are used to show the effectiveness of our proposed hybrid approach. Experimental results indicate that both implementations achieve significantly better performance due to optimization opportunities offered by the hybrid model, such as the funneled execution mode and fine-grained overlapping of communication and computation.},

Due to the frequent changes in GPU architecture, many clusters contain heterogeneous types of GPUs, leading to the problem of load distribution among the machines.

The algorithm finds a distribution of data that minimizes the execution time of the application, by guaranteeing that all GPUs spend the same amount of time processing its assigned kernels and data. We use the algorithm to execute the simulation of large scale neuronal networks. We show that the algorithm effectively balances the load among the GPUs and reduces the execution time of the application.},

The programming techniques currently employed on these GPUs are not sufficient to address problems exhibiting irregular, and unbalanced workload. The problem is exacerbated when trying to effectively exploit multiple GPUs concurrently, which are commonly available in many modern systems. In this paper, we propose a task-based dynamic load-balancing solution for single-and multi-GPU systems. The solution allows load balancing at a finer granularity than what is supported in current GPU programming APIs, such as NVIDIA's CUDA. We evaluate our approach using both micro-benchmarks and a molecular dynamics application that exhibits significant load imbalance. Experimental results with a single-GPU configuration show that our fine-grained task solution can utilize the hardware more efficiently than the CUDA scheduler for unbalanced workload. On multi-GPU systems, our solution achieves near-linear speedup, load balance, and significant performance improvement over techniques based on standard CUDA APIs.},

	Abstract = {Multicore machines equipped with accelerators are becoming increasingly popular. The TOP500-leading RoadRunner machine is probably the most famous example of a parallel computer mixing IBM Cell Broadband Engines and AMD opteron processors. Other architectures, featuring GPU accelerators, are expected to appear in the near future. To fully tap into the potential of these hybrid machines, pure offloading approaches, in which the main core of the application runs on regular processors and offloads specific parts on accelerators, are not sufficient. The real challenge is to build systems where the application would permanently spread across the entire machine, that is, where parallel tasks would be dynamically scheduled over the full set of available processing units. To face this challenge, we propose a new runtime system capable of scheduling tasks over heterogeneous, accelerator-based machines. Our system features a software virtual shared memory that provides a weak consistency model. The system keeps track of data copies within accelerator embedded-memories and features a data-prefetching engine. Such facilities, together with a database of self-tuned per-task performance models, can be used to greatly improve the quality of scheduling policies in this context. We demonstrate the relevance of our approach by benchmarking various parallel numerical kernel implementations over our runtime system. We obtain significant speedups and a very high efficiency on various typical workloads over multicore machines equipped with multiple accelerators.},
